        <h1> At <span class="logo"> <span class="logo" style="color: #df0e0e;">Cue</span> Contracting & Consulting LLC</span>,  We Take Pride In Our Work</h1>
        <p>Google review of Cue Contracting & Consulting LLC by Luis Barroeta
            ★★★★★ <br>"This is my personal recommendation for Jeremy Cue. I had the pleasure to work with Jeremy approximately for two years as his direct supervisor while I was the VP of Manufacturing @ Henry. When we started working together I quickly recognized that Jeremy was a very talented person with multiple positive attributes, one of the most relevant is his passion for what he does, his ability to problem solving and his knowledge/experience are impressive. I recommend Jeremy for any automation problem or improvements that any company is facing."</p>
